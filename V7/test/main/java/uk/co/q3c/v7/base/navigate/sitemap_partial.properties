[map]
# This section is the site map
# prefix view with ':'
# prefix label key with '~'
# structure of map entry is:
# indentation, url segment, then view and label key can be either way round
# indentation: the number of '-' represents tree indentation.  A single '-' is the highest level.
# base url: a page without a name (in other words the base url) is specified like this   -:   HomeView  ~ home
# if view not specified it is capitalised version of url segment (for url segment 'home' view is Home or HomeView depending on value of 'appendView')
# if label key is not specified, the url segment is used as it is
# example:  --secure :SecureHome ~home
# arbitrary spaces can be used, they are stripped out before processing
# if a url has been redirected, it is ignored for views and labels
# if standard pages are not defined in the map, they are added automatically - this does affect the order in which the pages are presented
